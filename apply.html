        <h3>Our Motivation</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Bloomers is a modernized debate club with the goal to provide Students with a platform to express themselves.
“For the longest time I wanted to start a debate club to expand my knowledge and gain public speaking skills,” Mead says. “Unfortunately I wasn’t able to start one in my school due to the lack of facilities.”
With no supportive colleagues and no way to start something at school, Mead says she had to be creative and think outside of the box. She decided to start an online club.
The decision wasn't finalised until Mead was accepted into a college preparation program, where she found equal minded people that supported her.
“During Tammyuz, I was lucky to be surrounded by creative individuals that motivated me to start the club.”
And so, Bloomers came to be.</p>

          edges in expressing our opinions while peacefully accepting other’s.
